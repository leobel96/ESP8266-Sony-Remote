# ESP8266-Sony-Remote
An How-To guide to create your own sony camera remote with a Wemos mini (a famous and cheap ESP8266 board) and many other parts. This guide will guide you with software configuration and components connection. The final result and the .stl file necessary for the box 3D printing can be found here. Feel free to fork this repository and remix it if you feel that something could be improved or modified. I made this remote mainly because I have a sony action camera (HDR-AS50) and spend more than 100$ for the original remote in my opinion is too much and also because I love the DIY and I wanted to made it myself. 
## Thanks
I start thanking with Reinhard Nickels (https://glaskugelsehen.wordpress.com/) from who I took inspiration and part of the code.
