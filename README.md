# ESP8266-Sony-Remote
An How-To guide to create your own sony camera remote with a Wemos mini R2 (a famous and cheap ESP8266 board) and many other parts. In the wiki I will guide you through software configuration and components connection. The final result and the .stl file necessary for the box 3D printing can be found in my thingiverse repo [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2933560). **Feel free to fork this repository and remix it** if you feel that something could be improved or modified. I made this remote mainly because I have a sony action camera (HDR-AS50) and spend more than 100$ for the original remote in my opinion is too much and also because I love the DIY and I wanted to made it myself. 
## Remote Characteristics:
The remote I've built is a simple rectangular enclosure with two push buttons (one to start/stop video recording and one to take a photo), a slider switch to turn it on and off and a rechargeable battery that should last many hours with the remote always powered on so, in a normal use, if you remember to always switch it off while you are not using it, it should last few months. To not add a buzzer or a led in the remote, I've decided to use another way to understand if the remote should be charged: switch all camera's sounds on. 
This remote has been tested with only my action camera but it should work with many other wifi-controllable sony cameras; in the first page of the wiki I'll show you how to understand if your camera is compatible.

## Thanks
I want to thank with Reinhard Nickels (https://glaskugelsehen.wordpress.com/) from who I took inspiration and part of the code.
